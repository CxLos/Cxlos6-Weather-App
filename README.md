# Cxlos6-Weather-App

## Description

The purpose of this project is to serve as a quick, handy weather app that gives you details on the current weather, as well as a snapshot of a 5-day forecast for any city that you search. With this project, I learned how to use APIs, and it was very challenging for me at first, but after repetitive use, tutoring, and reading the dcoumentation, I finally got a hold of it.
